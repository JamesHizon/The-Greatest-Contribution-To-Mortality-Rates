# The-Greatest-Contribution-To-Mortality-Rates
In my Regression Analysis class, worked on a group project using the R Programming language.  

In this project, we help determine what variables add the most contribution to mortality by observing correlation matrix, plotting graphs, reading ANOVA table, collinearity, multilinear regression, and more. After research analysis, we can infer whether the amount of a given pollutant, education level in a given area or poverty level has the highest correlation. This can lead to decision making practices such as implementing policies in a given area to increase education about a given pollutant or increase funding for environmental science programs to help reduce the speed of increasing mortality rates over time.
