# The-Greatest-Contribution-To-Mortality-Rates
In my Regression Analysis class, worked on a group project using the R Programming language.  

In this project, we help determine what variables add the most contribution to mortality by observing correlation matrix, plotting graphs, reading ANOVA table, collinearity, multilinear regression, and more.
